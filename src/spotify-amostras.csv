Wishbone Ash,Right Or Wrong,/w/wishbone+ash/right+or+wrong_20147150.html,"Like to have you 'round  
With all the lies that you make  
The things or darkness and you  
Some people say, have just a taste  
Right or wrong, you might get burned  
What you gain is what you learn  
  
Got one too many women  
Don't know quite which way to go  
They're all gettin' so expensive  
When they walk by themselves  
Right or wrong, don't regret  
What you went for is what you get  
  
No point in bitter tears  
When someone else has cut you down  
'Cause there's a time for leavin'  
And there's a time for stickin' around, hey  
Right or wrong, you've got to live  
So what you collect is what you give

Fall Out Boy,"Dance, Dance",/f/fall+out+boy/dance+dance_10113666.html,"She says she's no good with words but I'm worse  
Barely stuttered out  
A joke of a romantic stuck to my tongue  
And weighed down with words too overdramatic  
Tonight it's ""it can't get much worse""  
Vs. ""no one should ever feel like..""  
  
I'm two quarters and a heart down  
And I don't want to forget how your voice sounds  
These words are all I have so I write them  
I need them just to get by  
  
Dance, dance  
We're falling apart to half time  
Dance, dance  
And these are the lives you love to lead  
Dance this is the way they'd look  
If they knew how misery loved me  
  
  
You always fold just before you're found out  
Drink up its last call  
Last resort  
But only the first mistake and I  
  
I'm two quarters and a heart down  
And I don't want to forget how your voice sounds  
These words are all I have so I write them  
I need them just to get by  
  
Why don't you show me a little bit of spine  
You've been saving for his mattress (love)

Moody Blues,Peak Hour,/m/moody+blues/peak+hour_20291295.html,"I see it all through my window it seems.  
Never failing, like millions of eels.  
All that is wrong,  
No time to be won.  
Only to do  
What can be done.  
Peak hour,  
Peak hour,  
Peak hour.  
Minds are subject to what should be done.  
Problem solved, time cannot be won.  
One hour a day,  
One hour a night  
Sees crowds of people  
Home-aimed for flight.  
Peak hour,  
Peak hour,  
Peak hour.  
It makes me want to run out and tell them  
They've got time.  
Take a step back out and warn them  
I've found out I've got time.  
Minds are subject to what should be done.  
Problem solved, time cannot be won.  
One hour a day,  
One hour a night  
Sees crowds of people  
Home-aimed for flight.  
Peak hour,

You come back crazier, you'll feel better  
The more I disregard the signs, the more I fly  
The more I walk across the lines, the more I glide

Sia,Little Black Sandals,/s/sia/little+black+sandals_20662895.html,"I'm being dragged down, down by the hand  
The hand of a golden giant man  
He's crushing my knuckles  
Splitting my skin, he says he will  
If only I'd ask it of him  
  
He says  
Girl, it's your call  
You wanna fly  
You wanna fall  
So I shout  
I wanna get away from you  
As fast as I can  
I tell my feet to move it  
I hope they have a plan  
  
[Chorus]  
These little black sandals  
Are walking me away  
These little black sandals  
Are heading the right way  
These little black sandals  
Are walking me away  
These little black sandals  
Saved my life today  
  
So now I'm free  
Free  
From the big bad giant  
  
Who was stalking me  
Thank you feet, for guiding me  
I'm glad somehow I got brains down there, at least  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Sometimes I'm tempted  
Sometimes I am  
I would be lying if I said I didn't miss that giant man  
He was the line between pleasure and pain  
But me and the feet have some years to reclaim

Right from the start he was the stealing kind  
You'll never know how much it hurt me darling  
The night you left his loving on your mind  
I keep dreaming of you all the time  
Then and only then you're really mine  
There's sadness when you go away and I face another day  
Yet I keep dreaming of you all the time  
[ fiddle ]  
Last night again I dreamed we were together  
I held you close the way I used to do  
I kissed your lips and said I found my heaven  
You whispered low how much you love me too  
I keep dreaming of you...

Security, happiness.  
Unfortunate son cornered,  
Cowering in the pit of  
Circling panes of glass that  
Surround and reveal the ever present ""It"".  
  
""It"" is my move, my every look,  
Interpreting gestures,  
Informing other  
What's undercover and  
Lurking beneath my mask  
Of this year's featured model.  
Is this too much?  
Close your eyes.  
Care to look inside? I am I!  
  
What may appear  
Might easily be explained,  
But given the situation  
Of info saturation,  
What you feel can never go away.  
  
Steering perception? I am!  
Inviting contradiction? I am!  
It's my insistence  
You keep your distance  
From the glare behind my stare.  
So this is the way  
The game is played.  
You can leave now...  
But I think you'll stay. I am I!

Lou Reed,Hold On,/l/lou+reed/hold+on_20085223.html,"There's blacks with knives and whites with guns  
fighting in Howard Beach  
There's no such thing as human rights

A cop was shot in the head by a 10 year old kid named Buddah in  
Central Park last week  
The fathers are lined up by  
the coffins by the Statue of Bigotry  
You better hold on something's happening here  
You better hold on---meet you in Tompkins Square  
The dopers sent a message to the cops last weekend  
They shot him in the car where he sat  
And Eleanor Bumpres and Michael Stewart must have appreciated that  
There's a rampaging rage rising up like a plague of bloody vials  
washing up on the beach  
It'll take more than the Angels or Iron Mike Tyson  
to heal this bloody breach  
A junkie ran down a lady a pregnant dancer  
she'll never dance but the baby was saved  
He shot up some China White and nodded out at the wheel  
and he doesn't even remember a thing  
They shot that old lady  
'cause they thought she was a witness  
to a crime she didn't even see  
Whose home is the home of the brave by the Statue of Bigotry  
You got a black .38 and a gravity knife  
You still have to ride the train  
There's the smelly essence of N.Y. down there  
but you ain't no Bernard Goetz  
There's no Mafia lawyer  
to fight in your corner  
for that 15 minutes of fame  
The have and the have nots are bleeding in the tub  
That's New York's future not mine  
Oh you better hold on---something's happening here.

Maybe there's a god above  
All I ever learned from love  
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew you  
And it's not a cry you can hear at night  
Not somebody who's seen the light  
It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah  
  
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah  
  
Hallelujah

Yoko Ono,Light On The Other Side,/y/yoko+ono/light+on+the+other+side_20148654.html,"When I come to the dock and sit very still,  
I wonder why on earth we fight and kill.  
I see a light on the other side flickering to me,  
As if to say, you're alright, you'll find your way.  
  
The world is so beautiful when I'm out here,  
Why can't it be the same when we're back there?  
  
Above my head, straight ahead,  
I see a bird gliding  
As if to say, I'm alright, I'll find my way.  
  
Windows are shattered,  
Streets are battered,  
Kids are frightened,  
Men are still at war.  
  
Moms are feeling sad,  
Dads are feeling bad.  
I wanna know, I wanna know  
If the world's gone mad.  
  
Above my head, straight ahead,  
I see a bird gliding  
As if to say, I'm alright, I'll find my way.

Poison dart of desire

When the world don't seem so great,  
And it's hard enough you know  
I need you to be around  
When my conscience brings me down  
And the world seems so obscure  
I want you to be the one  
Who tells me off when I do wrong,  
And you know I can be bad  
I need you, I need you  
Say you'll stay, make my day  
Now what have I done,  
Was it something I said - oh dear  
I need you to turn me off,  
When you think I've said enough,  
To the extent of being a bore  
I need you to tell me no  
Slap my wrists and send me home  
Tell me I can't come again  
Now why are you crying -  
Have I gone too far - again  
I need you keep me straight,  
when the world don't seem so great  
and its hard enough you know  
I need you, I need you  
Say you'll stay  
Make my day

'Cause you deserve to know  
You are not the reason that I had to go,  
Late at night in these hotel rooms  
I think of all I've lost,  
What I've put you through  
  
And if I knew the reason  
I would tell you why somehow  
The feeling slipped away  
I only did what I had to do  
Not 'cause I wanted to  
  
I've got a guilty heart  
And a troubled mind  
No matter where I go  
You're never far behind  
I'd like to think  
That you've forgiven me  
But forgiveness ain't enough  
To wash my conscience clean  
  
Oh and if I knew the reason  
I would tell you why somehow  
The feeling slipped away  
I only did what I had to do  
Not 'cause I wanted to  
  
I only did what I had to do  
Not 'cause I wanted to

Peter Cetera,Only Love Knows Why,/p/peter+cetera/only+love+knows+why_20107380.html,"One more sad tomorrow  
And I'm not very good at hiding my sorrow  
It's not the same without you  
So alone and so afraid  
I thought we had it made  
What about us, what about the way  
We were so in love, when we were together  
I thought you'd never leave  
Now I know this time you're gone forever  
  
[Chorus]  
Only love can break your heart  
Fill you with desire  
And tear you all apart  
Only love can make you cry  
Only love knows why  
  
One more night without you  
I'm just trying to pretend that you're coming back again  
You know I never meant to doubt you, oh no  
We were young and we were free  
Now I can't believe this has happened to me  
  
What about us, what about the way  
We were so in love, when we were together  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Gonna be a long hard road without you  
And there's one thing you should know  
Tell me who will I turn to  
When I get in trouble  
I really don't want you to go, no  
  
Tell me who can I turn to  
When I get in trouble  
Baby please don't leave me  
Can't you see you must believe me  
  
Only love can break your heart  
Fill you with desire  
And tear you down, the minute that you fall apart  
  
Only love can make you cry  
Only love knows why, oh no  
Only love can tear you down  
Only love knows why, oh no  
  
Only love will make you cry

Gino Vannelli,Father And Son,/g/gino+vannelli/father+and+son_20499776.html,"Once in a life there comes a man like you  
And you bear a son so much like yourself  
And it's hard to believe that he's a grown man  
But pop I understand  
  
Once every night I thank my lucky stars  
You've given me some guiding light  
But there comes a time when a father and a son  
Can no longer be as one  
  
It took me so long to recover  
From the pain of having denied the love I once relied upon  
It takes more than time to discover  
That for both the young and old  
The truth is sometimes cold but right  
  
This is my life  
And I've got to hold my own  
Even if it means hurting us both  
And the wrongs become right when  
We stop and wonder how  
Look at us  
We're better friends now

Overkill,Gasoline Dream,/o/overkill/gasoline+dream_20205640.html,"Wishful thinking, eyes are blinking,  
In the sun the garbage stinking.  
To ignore the rancid, won't make it go away.  
  
Untruth spoke through blistered lip,  
Unclean thoughts that take the step,  
Down upon the roaches,  
Won't go away.  
  
Born! to follow!  
To be the first to swallow,  
Garbage from the plate.  
Now! to borrow!  
A match, ignite the gasoline,  
To burn away.  
  
Surviving through a gasoline dream,  
In the month the razon blade gleam,  
Slashing up the tongue, won't make it go away.  
On a binge of self destruction,  
  
Children of the reconstruction,  
Suck the tit of discontent,  
Go away.  
  
Slam! slam down!  
Respond in kind malcontent,  
Don't go away.  
Burn! burn down!  
  
Temple of the conscience,  
Don't go away.  
  
I was soaked in gasoline,  
Playin' with a match.  
I was everything I seemed,  
They stood and watched.  
  
Ate from your table!  
Ate from your hand!  
Eight days of waiting!  
Buried in the sand!  
  
Burn in a gasoline dream, burn away my love.  
Burn away the conscience, burn away, my love.  
Take away my dignity, take away my pain,  
Take just for taking, we are one in the same...  
  
Burn... Burn...  
Burn in a gasoline dream, burn away my love.  
Burn away the conscience, burn away, my love.

And I can just see your smile as you read about all that I've done

And things are gonna work out just fine  
Cause I know the sun's gonna shine  
Shine on me this time

I've seen uncertainty and fear  
Keep on lookin' for tomorrow

Beautiful South,Last Waltz,/b/beautiful+south/last+waltz_10026958.html,"Don't feel bad if you wake up feeling suddenly old  
More the realisation that you've let yourself be covered by mould  
Age is not something you wrap up if you're feeling the cold  
It's a laugh ten times harder at a joke eleven times told  
  
Down to the churchyard, check out the vaults  
Dig up the coffins, unscrew the bolts  
No better reminder, no strong enough salts  
To show this pitiful few that we've missed the last waltz  
  
Don't feel bad if you're feeling past you sell-by date  
Like the roller coaster ride slowed down to a serious debate  
Oh the weather you tell them you're ready or whether you wait  
Does someone place a hand on your shoulder you point the way to the gate  
  
Down to the churchyard, check out the vaults  
Dig up the coffins, unscrew the bolts  
No better reminder, no strong enough salts  
To show this pitiful few that we've missed the last waltz  
  
You don't count the birthdays 'til your out on your own  
They come thicker and faster and too damn late to postpone  
And wisdom's the last thing the scientists willing to clone  
Science advances, maturity dances alone

Sitting in the drive  
And I could see you in my football jersey raking leaves  
I could see me hanging lights on our first Christmas tree  
I could see us nail those numbers on the door that afternoon  
  
At 727 East Magnolia Avenue  
They added on where we thought we would  
You always said it would sure look good  
They cut down that tree we were afraid would fall  
  
Looks like they picked up right where we left off  
I could see you out there on the deck soaking up the sun  
I could see me chasing you around with a water gun  
I could see us there together  
  
Seemed the sky was always blue  
At 727 East Magnolia Avenue  
If I could make one wish  
Oh, I'd relive my life with you

High on his campaign promises  
I don't wanna come down  
I don't wanna come down  
But no promises he made me could persuade me  
Like the loneliness that comes on when I  
Try to go on without him  
Try to doubt him  
I confess, I have to confess  
He took my heart, it was a landslide  
You know it was a landslide

In heaven when he's around

Don't start havin' a showdown  
Keep on handin' the jug round  
All that you need is wine and good company

Elvis Presley,Girl Of Mine,/e/elvis+presley/girl+of+mine_20048808.html,"When your asleep beside me, I watch you lying there  
Your hand upon the pillow and moonlight in your hair  
I get the warmest feeling, so good I almost cry  
I kiss your sleeping lips and say I'll love you 'till I die  
Oh girl of mine you make my day  
One sunny smile and all the clouds just roll away  
Eyes deep as the sea seem to say to me  
Our love will always be  
So girl of mine turn out the light  
And in my arms together we'll make sweet love tonight  
Down life's golden road and you'll always know  
I love you ... girl of mine  
Sometimes I know I hurt you when things ain't goin' right  
I walk away and leave you to face the lonely night  
I wouldn't blame you darlin' if you walked out on me  
But I return to find you there still waiting patiently  
Oh girl of mine you make my day  
One sunny smile and all the clouds just roll away  
Eyes deep as the sea seem to say to me  
Our love will always be  
So girl of mine turn out the light  
And in my arms together we'll make sweet love tonight  
Down life's golden road and you'll always know  
I love you ... girl of mine

I recall that I saw your smile

A few kisses ago  
  
I remember you-ooh  
You're the one who said ""I love you, too""  
Yes, I do, didn't ya know?  
  
I remember, too, a distant bell and stars that fell  
Like the rain out of the blue  
  
When my life is through  
And the angels ask me to recall  
The thrill of it all  
Then I will tell them I remember you-ooh

Most of them fulfilled, and that's a lot  
Let your soft gentle hands caress my body

So tell me what he's got that I ain't got  
  
Laura, see these walls that I built for you  
Laura, see this carpet that I laid  
See those fancy curtains on the windows  
Touch those satin pillows on your bed

Note the name upon the checkbook in your bag  
And if there's time before I pull this trigger

Riding in the car with 2 niggas and a pistol

I already know the plan, hop out and get on your mans  
And take what he got  
Go through pockets, wallets and socks, dig all the knots  
This a stick-up  
Phone ring, it's my mama in the middle of some drama  
So I don't pick up thinking I gotta get my shit up  
I gotta pick my bitch up  
Let's hurry up and leave, I feel the police near us  
So we left with a thousand dollars cash  
It was me and my nigga so you know I went half

I pace back and forth and look around  
For something to sink my teeth into

Calling strays over nigga leading months gone  
Conversate for fo' hours, wasting mo' power

of the scars that won't heal  
Your eyes have died  
But you see more than I  
Daniel you're a star  
in the face of the sky  
  
Daniel is traveling tonight on a plane  
I can see the red tail lights heading for Spain  
Oh and, I can see Daniel waving goodbye  
God it loks like Daniel  
Must be the clouds in my eyes  
Oh God,  
It looks like Daniel  
Must be the clouds in my eyes

Joni Mitchell,I Don't Know Where I Stand,/j/joni+mitchell/i+dont+know+where+i+stand_20075291.html,"Funny day, looking for laughter and finding it there  
Sunny day, braiding wild flowers and leaves in my hair  
Picked up a pencil and wrote ""I love you"" in my finest hand  
Wanted to send it, but I don't know where I stand  
  
Telephone, even the sound of your voice is still new  
All alone in California and talking to you  
And feeling too foolish and strange to say the words that I had planned  
I guess it's too early, 'cause I don't know where I stand  
  
Crickets call, courting their ladies in star-dappled green  
Thickets tall, until the morning comes up like a dream  
All muted and misty, so drowsy now I'll take what sleep I can  
I know that I miss you, but I don't know where I stand  
I know that I miss you, but I don't know where I stand

And all the lightning sends a chill

But we could have been better  
And the best is what we're after  
When it comes right down to love  
You were always the strong one  
  
Bright as the setting sun  
Go shine somewhere else my love  
Some brand new world (some brand new world)

First forgiveness

Freaks of a faded memory

Outlaws, When we were forever young  
When we were outlaws  
We're outlaws of redemption, baby  
Hooligans  
We destroyed suburbia  
When we were outlaws  
We're Outlaws of forever, baby

Breaking in cars  
Running in the light of the moon  
Lost souls  
Bottle rockets  
All that we wanted  
It's for our lives beyond stars

But when beauty met the beast he froze.  
Got the sense I was not her type  
By a black eye and bloody nose,  
But I guess that's the way it goes.

But the female mystique takes my breath away.  
So give me a smile or give me a sneer,  
'Cause I'm trying to guess here.

If love was a beam, you'd be blind in both eyes.  
Put your sunglasses on 'cause you're a deer in the headlights.  
  
You're the deer in the headlights.  
You're the deer in the headlights.

Ate with augustine monks, babbled in tongues  
Climbed the highest hill in peru  
Took a walk on the ganges, peeled the wraps of rameses  
Slayed me a dragon or two  
Turned saviors and saints, and little green men  
Moonshine and miracle drugs  
But I never quite saw the light  
'till I fell in love  
Pondered zen and zoroaster, and the life ever after

Found jesus and siddhartha in a bar in djakarta  
Chatting where the air is quite rare

Let jove keep his heavens above

Torn apart by the phenomenon of lightning  
Rain is pouring down my (now) shivering shoulders  
In the rain my tears are forever lost  
  
The darkened oaks are my only shelter  
Red leaves are blown by the wind  
An ebony raven now catches my eye  
Sitting in calmness  
Before spreading his black wings  
Reaching for the skies  
  
In this forest  
Where wolves cry their agony unto the moon  
My spirit is hidden  
In the form of wisdom  
Carved on a black stone  
The only way to follow  
  
Open your soul  
Redeem, I am immortal  
  
Blinded by a light  
My soul is held up in glory  
I engulf the skies

Through the eternal flame I travel

What's your preference where do you stand  
You get all uptight about it  
Wanna fight about it  
Wanna fight about love  
No no no  
Wanting independence separate but equal  
A lover here another there  
One more for the sequel to the heartache  
How much more can we take  
Wont you tell me  
How long will we be victims of fear  
With a man and a gun and the day after fear  
Jesus smile down upon your children  
Smile down upon your family  
  
Now Im talking about  
Altruism and unification  
We forgotten what that means  
Cynicism in this mighty nation  
And hatred is spitting us right at the seams  
  
Oh but I still believe that good will prevail  
And if we don't ever try  
Its damn sure that well fail  
Lose another day  
The american way  
So come all believers  
Come all races  
Start looking at the souls  
Not at the faces  
And were there  
And were learning to care  
I want to know baby  
How long will we be victims of fear  
With a man and a gun and the day after fear  
Jesus smile down upon your children  
Smile down upon your family  
Jesus smile down upon your children  
Smile down upon your family

Don't want to be the last in line  
Don't want to be just left behind

To hang out with the big shots

Waylon Jennings,Gonna Write A Letter,/w/waylon+jennings/gonna+write+a+letter_20649788.html,"I'm gonna write a letter, gonna mail it today  
Just as soon as I think of the words to say  
I've been needing to send it for nearly a year  
There's a woman back home who's waiting to hear  
  
I meant to tell you, dear Susannah  
I'm a long way from Louisiana and you  
And I know I promised to be returning  
Just as soon as I've saved the money I'm earning for you  
  
But I'm married to twins and I'm living in Peru  
Well, I'm gonna write a letter  
Get it off my mind  
But you know the words  
Are so hard to find  
  
Sitting, thinking with my pen in my hand  
How can I make her understand?  
I meant to tell you, dear Julia  
  
I'm a long way from the States, mosquitoes and you  
I'll send some money to help with the kids  
I'd like to thank you for all that you did  
It's true Louisiana, and I'm with Susannah, too  
  
Got me a letter, it arrived today  
The words I read just blew me away  
I don't believe I've ever felt so low  
How could Susannah treat me so?  
  
She said, ""I meant to tell you, my sweet honey  
I'm a long way from your love, your money and you  
Please don't think me under  
  
And I do believe you'll understand me too  
I got a bar and grill with Phil in Kalamazoo

John Prine,My Own Best Friend,/j/john+prine/my+own+best+friend_20074690.html,"I'm beginning to like you  
But, you know that ain't right  
'Cause you'll just twist and twist and twist  
Till I'm all crooked inside  
You'll take all you gave me  
Like it never was there  
And I think that I might, no, I know  
Yes, I will help you there  
'Cause, I've done it before and I'd do it again  
'Cause it's the only time  
That makes me feel like I'm  
My own best friend  
I'm a victim of friction, I got too close to see  
Yeah, we sparked in the dark and God hung a light on me  
The lamp gets real heavy, it hangs from my heart  
And it comes and it goes till I can't tell the difference apart  
But I've done it before and I'd do it again  
'Cause it's the only time  
That makes me feel like I'm  
My own best friend  
So many people say, it will never work out that way  
You can't stand the heat  
While you're watching your heart  
Just melt away in the basement on a rainy day  
There's motel in Shreveport  
Don't ask me where, please  
They check in, they check out  
By the light of the color T.V.s  
The maid calls you honey  
She makes your bed slow  
And she speaks, of the sheets that don't fit  
But you know that she knows  
I've done it before and I'd do it again  
'Cause it's the only time  
That makes me feel like I'm  
My own best friend, my own best friend  
My own best friend, my own best friend

Lou Reed,Fly Into The Sun,/l/lou+reed/fly+into+the+sun_20085207.html,"I would not run from the holocaust  
I would not run from the bomb  
I'd welcome the chance to meet my maker  
And fly into the sun, fly into the sun, fly into the sun  
I'd break up into million pieces and fly into the sun  
  
I would not run from the blazing light  
I would not run from its rain  
I'd see it as an end to misery  
As an end to worldly pain  
An end to worldly pain ...  
I'd shine by the light of the unknown moment  
To end this worldly pain  
Fly into the sun, fly into the sun  
I'd shine by the light of the unknown moment  
And fly into the sun  
  
The earth is weeping, the sky is shaking  
The stars split to their core  
And every proton and unnamed neutron  
is fusing in my bones  
And an unnamed mammal is darkly rising  
As man burns from his tomb  
And I look at this as a blissful moment  
To fly into the sun  
  
Fly into the sun, fly into the sun  
I'd burn up into a million pieces  
And fly into the sun  
To end this mystery answer my mystery  
I'd look at this as a wondrous moment  
To end this mystery  
Fly into the sun, fly into the sun  
I'd break up into a million pieces  
And fly into the sun

Andy Williams,People,/a/andy+williams/people_20997917.html,"People, people who need people  
Are the luckiest people in the world  
  
We're children needing other children  
And yet, letting our grown up pride  
Hide all the need inside  
Acting more like children than children  
  
Lovers, are very special people  
They're the luckiest people in the world  
With one person  
One very special person  
A feeling deep in your soul says  
You were half, now you're whole  
  
No more hunger and thirst  
But first be a person who needs people  
People who need people  
Are the luckiest people in the world
